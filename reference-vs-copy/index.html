    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    // one way
    team2 = players.slice()

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // with Objects
    const person = {

      age: 80
    };
    // and think we make a copy:

    // const captain = person
    // captain.number = 99

    // how do we take a copy instead
    const captain = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99, age: 31})
    console.log('Captain', captain)
    console.log('Original', person)

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // const cap2 = {...person}

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
